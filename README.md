**Summary**

Based in these analyses, there is a high demand for bike rentals. With both male and females renting out bikes at a fast rate. The most popular time is Monday, Tuesday and Thursdays. With Monday and Tuesday at 8, 9 am and 5,6 pm. Thursdays with 8 am and 5,6 pm. This is all throughout the month of August which has warm weather perfect for biking.

I would suggest doing a visualization of weather patterns throughout the year to see which month is adequate for bike riding. I would also suggest a traffic pattern visualization to keep track on heavy traffic to avoid during bike riding sessions.
